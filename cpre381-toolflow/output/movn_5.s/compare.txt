Oh no...

Cycle: 4
MARS instruction number: na	Instruction: na
Expected:	Execution stopped

Student execution improperly continued

Almost! your processor completed the program with  1/3 allowed mismatches

Helpful resources for Debugging:
ms.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
mars.trace : output from MARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
